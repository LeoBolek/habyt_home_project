Built a scalable rental system using Python and Docker. 

The system fetches rental data from an API, transforms it based on a predefined schema and serializes the data into CSV files. Designed to handle both individual and business rentals, the system accommodates various entities such as properties, units, applicants, co-applicants, prices, concessions, and fees. Dockerized for easy deployment, ensuring seamless execution in any environment

NOTE:
All of the files inside /output_data were downloaded from the Docker image.
If you wish to see the results after running docker_run.bash, please look inside the Docker image.
